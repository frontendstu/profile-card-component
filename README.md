## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I felt that this one wasn't too much of a challenge. I wasn't 100% sure what the right approach was for the profile stats. Should I have used a `<ul>`? or was using flexbox good practice. I'm not sure. I looked at a few other solutions and from the other solutions I found that this was the most common approach.

This challenge was more a quick one to fill in some time and make my way through all of the newbie challenges.
